## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/suetarazi/magic-8-ball.git
```
Once downloaded, you can either use the dotnet CLI utilities or Visual Studio 2017 (or greater) to build the web application. The solution file is located in the AmandaFE subdirectory at the root of the repository.
```
cd YourRepo/YourProject
dotnet build
```
The dotnet tools will automatically restore any NuGet dependencies. Options for running and debugging the application using IIS Express or Kestrel are provided within Visual Studio. From the command line, the following will start an instance of the Kestrel server to host the application:
```
cd YourRepo/YourProject
dotnet run
```
